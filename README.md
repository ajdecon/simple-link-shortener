# simple-link-shortener

A really, really simple link shortener in Clojure.

NOTE: You should absolutely not use this in
production, as it has no concept of authentication, no rate limiting,
uses an SQLite DB... Basically, it's a toy program. :-)

## Prerequisites

You will need [Leiningen][] 2.0.0 or above installed.

[leiningen]: https://github.com/technomancy/leiningen

## Running

To set up the SQLite DB, run:

    lein migratus migrate

To start a web server for the application, run:

    lein ring server

To create a new shortened link, POST a request to the `/` endpoint:

    $ curl -H "Content-Type: application/json" -X POST -d '{"url":"http://www.google.com"}' http://localhost:3000/
    {"result":"tkgbedts"}

The result is the id for the short link. So you can then go to `http://localhost:3000/<id>`
to go to the destination link.
